# Lesson-ImageProcessingInBME
My homework in Image Processing in BME. The algorithms are implemented by C++. The user interface is designed by QT5.

### Project 1: Basics
- [x] Histogram
- [x] OSTU algorithm
- [x] Cross entropy algorithm

### Project 2: Filters
- [x] Convolution filter
- [x] Sobel filter
- [x] Roberts filter
- [x] Prewitt filter
- [x] Gaussian filter
- [x] Median filter

### Project 3: Basic morphology
- [x] Morphology opening for binary/gray-scale image
- [x] Morphology closing for binary/gray-scale image
- [x] Morphology erosion for binary/gray-scale image
- [x] Morphology dilation for binary/gray-scale image

### Project 4: Advanced morphology
- [x] Morphology distance transform for binary image
- [x] Morphology skeleton for binary image
- [x] Morphology restoration for binary image
- [x] Morphology edge/gradient detection for binary/gray-scale image
- [x] Morphology conditional dilation for binary image
- [x] Morphology OBR and CBR for binary/gray-scale image
